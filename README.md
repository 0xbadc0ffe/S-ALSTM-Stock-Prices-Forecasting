# Stochastic Attention Based LSTM for Stock prices Forecasting.

## Architecture
This model is based on daily traiding and it never keeps a position overnight. Hereafter it is shown the model architecture.

The stochasticity is relvant only in the prediction of the trend direction, the displacement value ( $\Delta$-close price ) is therefore deterministic.



## Metrics

The model considers fees (by default 0.1%) on both buying and selling positions. The PPM is the profitability performance measure that clarify when the model, net of fees, is more profitable of the buy&hold strategy. If PPM>1 the model is therefore useful. In particular, the next figure shows the PPM of two buy-policies on a test dataset at training time.

## Features
It is reasonable to set the SALSTM into deterministc mode once it is deployed, but nonetheless we can still exploit its distribution parameters. The $\sigma$ value can be seen as measure of the model uncertainty and can be used at inference time estimate local volatility. Therefore we can exploit this to define a buy-policy that depends also on how much the model feels the prediction risky. The following figure shows the $\sigma$ values (blue) vs the $\Delta$-close prices (orange) of the stock.
